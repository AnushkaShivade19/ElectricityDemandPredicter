Power Demand Prediction for Disaster Management
Overview
This project focuses on predicting power demand in regions prone to natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, and storms. Accurate power demand prediction is crucial during and after a disaster, as it helps in the efficient distribution of energy resources, minimizing downtime, and ensuring the safety and recovery of affected areas. By predicting power demand based on various features like weather, timestamps, and seasonal variations, this model can assist energy suppliers and disaster management agencies in making informed decisions during crises.

Problem Statement
During a disaster, the demand for electricity can drastically change due to various factors such as disrupted infrastructure, increased use of generators, or shifts in population movement. This unpredictability in demand can overwhelm the existing power grid, leading to power outages, delayed recovery, and inefficiencies in disaster relief efforts.

Solution
The Power Demand Prediction Model leverages machine learning techniques, particularly Random Forest Regressor, to predict electricity demand in disaster-prone regions. The model incorporates multiple features like weather data, timestamp (month, day), seasonality, and other relevant factors to provide accurate and real-time power demand forecasts. This can support disaster management efforts by helping agencies predict peak demand periods, allowing for better preparedness and response.

Key Features and Applications
1. Accurate Power Demand Prediction
Using a Random Forest Regressor, the model predicts future power consumption based on input features such as:

Timestamp: Month, day, and time of day.

Weather conditions: Temperature, humidity, and pressure.

Seasonal variations: Different demand patterns during summer, winter, and rainy seasons.

Special events/holidays: Predicting peaks due to festivities or holidays.

2. Disaster Response and Recovery
In the aftermath of a disaster, understanding the power demand is critical. This model can:

Forecast energy needs in real time, helping disaster management agencies to prioritize power restoration efforts.

Optimize power grid allocation by predicting high-demand areas and scheduling energy restoration efficiently.

Monitor infrastructure and ensure that power supplies meet the needs of hospitals, shelters, and other essential services.

3. Resource Allocation and Load Balancing
The model helps in:

Allocating resources effectively during a disaster by identifying areas with high power demand.

Reducing strain on the power grid by predicting power usage and ensuring distribution is aligned with current and future needs.

4. Integration with IoT and Smart Grids
The model can be integrated with smart grids and IoT-based sensors that monitor electricity usage in real time. This integration:

Helps in tracking changes in power consumption based on disaster events.

Allows dynamic adjustments to power distribution, ensuring that areas with critical needs are prioritized.

5. Scenario Planning and Simulation
The tool can simulate different disaster scenarios, helping governments and agencies:

Plan for worst-case scenarios, such as large-scale storms or power grid failures.

Evaluate the impact of natural disasters on power demand and infrastructure, facilitating proactive measures.

6. Disaster Management Dashboards
A web-based dashboard can display:

Real-time predictions of power demand.

Location-specific insights, showing areas with the highest demand.

Historical analysis to understand demand fluctuations based on previous disasters and seasons.

Alerts and notifications to inform authorities about potential issues in the power grid.

How It Works
Data Collection: The model collects historical data on power usage, weather, and timestamps.

Data Preprocessing: Data is cleaned and features like weather patterns, seasons, and holidays are extracted.

Model Training: The Random Forest Regressor is trained on the preprocessed data to predict power demand based on the input features.

Prediction and Evaluation: Once the model is trained, it can predict power demand for future time periods. The performance is evaluated using metrics like mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared.

Deployment: The model is deployed through a Flask API, allowing users to access predictions in real time.

Technical Stack
Backend: Python, Flask, Joblib

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (RandomForestRegressor), Numpy, Pandas
